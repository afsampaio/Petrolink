Petrolink Challenge

(28-01-2018)
Master contains no code.
(Currently) There are three other branches, nonConcurrent, Concurrent-v1.0 and Concurrent-v2.0. They implement the challenge in different
ways. The most updated (and faster) is: Concurrent-v2.0.

The master also contains a small breakdown of the implemented logic up to today.
