(26/01/2018)
Master contains no code.
(Currently) There are two other branches, nonConcurrent and Concurrent-v1.0. The concurrent version is the most updated one.

The master also contains a small breakdown of the implemented logic up to today.

I will have an updated version of the concurrent logic by Monday.
