Petrolink Challenge

(28-01-2018)
Master contains no code.
There are three other branches, nonConcurrent, Concurrent-v1.0 and Concurrent-v2.0. They implement the challenge in different
ways. The most updated (and faster) is: Concurrent-v2.0.

The master also contains a small breakdown of the implemented logic up to today.

Instructions:
To run the code, either run with no arguments and (as long as the db is the same folder) the system will go to default values
and do accordingly. Should you wish to run it with specific parameters, order is: db_name, csv file name, xml file name.
